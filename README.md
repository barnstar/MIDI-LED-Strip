MIDI LED

A simple Midi lib to read events, and drive a WS2811 LED strip (via the included AdaFruit drivers).

As midi events are generated, the corresponding led will light up with a random hue with the intensity based on the velocity.  The LED strip will light up with with a "splash" effect, with the colour bleeding over to the surrounding leds.

The colour calculation here are just capable of running fairly well on an aruduino nano.
